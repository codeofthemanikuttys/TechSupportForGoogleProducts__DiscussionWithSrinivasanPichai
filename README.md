#Discussion with Srinivasan Pichai

I don't know what you people out there do, but whenever I have a tech support issue with Google products, I simply email Vasan Pichai, who happens to be Sundar Pichai's brother.

I know there are other ways to do it, but this is my preferred method. #humor

But seriously, if any of you out there know the answer to this question, please let me know.

(In case you don't believe me, please see a sample email I sent recently in the /data folder. As I clarified, the screenshot is not a screenshot of my own computer -- it is a screenshot I downloaded from the Web.)
